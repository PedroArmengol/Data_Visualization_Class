This is a study for the datavisualization class (The University of Chicago: MSCAPP program). 
The ideas behind this project is to depict the relationship between the firearms industry 
in the U.S and the increase of organize crime related murders in Mexico. The channel of causality
between this two phenomenons is, arguably, the weapons smuggling from the U.S to Mexico.
