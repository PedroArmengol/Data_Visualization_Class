### Traffic fatalities in the US

Traffic fatalities are on the rise in the United States. 40,200 people died in 2016 due to motor vehicle accidents,
according to the National Safety Council. This is a 14 percent increase in the last two years, and the state of
Illinois is fairing even worse.
Various experts attribute this increases to distracted driving, more speeding, lax enforcement of seatbelt
laws, and a better economy (leading to more driving), but there is little consensus. Even before the dire
2016 numbers, the Obama White House and DoT even issued a call to action to analyze this data and help
mitigate the problem.

The datasets used in this exercise are here the following ones:

• The 2014 SAS Data ftp://ftp.nhtsa.dot.gov/FARS/2014/National/

• The 2015 CSV Data: ftp://ftp.nhtsa.dot.gov/FARS/2015/National/
